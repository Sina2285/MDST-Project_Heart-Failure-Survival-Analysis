# Heart Failure Survival Analysis

**Michigan Data Science Team | Winter 2026**

Project Leads: Sina Bonakdar & Terry Zhang

---

## Executive Summary

Survival analysis of heart failure patients is critical for identifying key factors that distinguish survival from mortality. This project provides a comprehensive, hands-on learning experience in clinical data science.

Through this tutorial series, students will:

- Implement **visualization tools** to extract meaningful insights from clinical data
- Apply **statistical and analytical methods** to understand feature relationships
- Build **machine learning and deep learning classifiers** to predict patient outcomes
- Evaluate model performance using **multiple evaluation metrics**

**Key Finding**: By the end of this project, students will discover that only **two features** are sufficient to distinguish survival from death using various classifiers.
